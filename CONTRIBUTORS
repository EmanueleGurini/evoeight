# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the Evoeight repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, Evoeight contributors are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because authors holds the copyright.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file,
# either J's name or J's organization's name should be
# added to the AUTHORS file, depending on whether the
# individual or corporate CLA was used.

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address>
#     Individual's name <submission email address> <email2> <emailN>
#
# An entry with multiple email addresses specifies that the
# first address should be used in the submit logs and
# that the other addresses should be recognized as the
# same person when interacting with Git.

# Please keep the list sorted.
